Test Document for Paper Editor

This is a plain text file that will be converted to markdown.

Features to Test:
- Text paragraphs are preserved
- Line breaks are handled correctly
- Special characters like & and < are preserved

Multiple paragraphs should be separated properly.

This is another paragraph after a blank line.

And this is the final paragraph with some inline text like *emphasis* and **strong** text that should be preserved as-is in the markdown.
